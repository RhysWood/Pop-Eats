=========

## Overview
Pop.Eats is a single restaurant ordering app created by [Rhys](https://github.com/RhysWood), [Bryson](https://github.com/brysonbest) & [Lenil](https://github.com/lenilsamuel). The app serves as an intermediary for both the client (customer) and the restaurant. 

Customers can log in, place orders, view their previous orders and update their profile. As a restaurant owner, the user can also update the menu as well as accept and process orders. When an order is placed, the user recieved a text confirming receipt and showing the restaurants estimated pick-up time.
